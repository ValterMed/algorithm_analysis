# Binary tree
The purpose of this README is to describe in a briefly way what is a binary tree and what its characteristics are.
You can check out the binary tree I developed using Python in the folder called scripts.

## What is a binary tree?
It is a non-linear data structre in which each node can have at most 2 children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.
- It is a hierarchical structure.
- The top-most node is called **root**.
- The bottom-most nodes are called **leaves**.

### Binary search tree
This is a type of binary tree that is in ordered form. It has the following conditions:
- Each node contains: data, pointer to the left child and pointer to the right child.
- Left child of the node must have a value less than its parent's value.
- Right child of the node must have a value greater than its parent's value.
