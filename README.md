# Linked list vs Array

The purpose of this repository is to make a comparison between linked lists and arrays in Python.
Before to do so, we need to define and understand what they are. So let's dive into it.

## What is a linked list?
It is a type of linear data structure that is used to store data in an organized way. In a linked list each element is a node. Each node contains two parts: data (value of the element) and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

There different types of linked list such as sigle-linked list, double-linked list or circular-linked list. 
- In this case, I am going to use a **single-linked list** in which traversing is done in a forward direction.

## What is an array?
It is a data structure that is used to store a collection of items at contiguous memory locations. Its constraint is that all the elements should be of the same type. Also, each data element can be accessed directly by only using its index number.

## Comparison

What is going to be compared is the execution time each data structure needs to insert elements.
