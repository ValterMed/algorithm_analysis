exploring the complexity of algorithms


# Excercise

## An implementation for linked lists is built.

Then, a graph is made to observe the execution times for inserting elements between a linked list and an array from the python numpy library.

It is suggested to add a linear function to the final graph to generate visual perspective.


# Instructions for upload this Task

Each student must upload their own implementation to this repository, to do so they must create a branch using the following nomenclature:
"name-lastName"
Finally perform the push.
